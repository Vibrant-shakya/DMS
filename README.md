Disaster Management Project for Kubernetes
This project provides a script to dynamically backup the manifest of Kubernetes resources such as deployments, ingresses, secrets, config maps, and more. The backup files are then uploaded to an artifact repository for safekeeping. In the event of a disaster, the project can help restore the entire namespace and its components with a single command.
